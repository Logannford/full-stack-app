Find a way to export the sql db on docker-compose down

make more args to pass into the $scope to use in select method
	- order dob?
	- order date created?

find a nice way to output all of the data that we get back from the select method

make sure the select method is secure

make the seo_friendly_url function more secure and robust

create a sign up page which will use ajax to send over the credentials
	- remember to use $_GET to get them from the url
	- if the username exists
		- run a function which will keep creating suggested names, then return them
		- create a new class for randomWords for an api request
			- have a method that generates and returns random words 
			- try to use abstraction
		
	- then send a 2FA email on sign up 
		- generate a rnd code for the user which expires after x amount of time
	- get a nice loader for the ajax cos we're fancy
	- create a new class for the user
		- will need to create connections between them and other users when they become friends

then a login in functionality 
	- if no email is found in the db then redirect to the sign up page
	- if the email is correct but the password has been entered wrong 3+ times
		- send an email to the email email address 
	- allow for password reset

	-- TO LINK THE DB TO THE LOGGED IN USER --
	- create a unique session id
	- link to the user that signed in
	- use session storage
		- create the unique id ON SIGNUP
		- assign it to the user in the db
		- use js to pass it through to session storage?
		-- do more research on that
