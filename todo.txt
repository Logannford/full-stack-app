make more args to pass into the $scope to use in select method

	- order date created?

find a nice way to output all of the data that we get back from the select method

create a sign up page which will use ajax to send over the credentials
	- remember to use $_GET to get them from the url
	- then send a 2FA email on sign up 
		- generate a rnd code for the user which expires after x amount of time
	- get a nice loader for the ajax cos we're fancy
	- create a new class for the user
		- create a new table for them on sign up?
		- will need to create connections between them and other users when they become friends

then a login in functionality 
	- if no email is found in the db then redirect to the sign up page
